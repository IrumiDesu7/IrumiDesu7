## Why I Build
I believe that well-crafted web applications should be more than just functionalâ€”they should be fast, accessible, and delightful to use. Every line of code I write is driven by the vision that better frontend architecture directly translates to better user experiences for thousands of people.

## How I Approach Development
I achieve this through modern frontend architecture, type-safe development, and performance-first design. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Next.js 15, React 19, and micro-frontend patterns, I build scalable solutions that grow with business needs while maintaining code quality and developer experience.

## What I Do
Frontend developer with 2+ years building production applications serving thousands of users across Indonesia. Recently architected micro-frontend solutions for enterprise wealth management systems and full-stack platforms with real-time capabilities.
